            <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>
            <li>2 green onions (white part only), choppe</li>
            <li>Â½ cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        </ul>     
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. 
                Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, 
                about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool 
                enough to handle.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine 
                vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine
                 potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season
                  with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss,
                   taking care not to break the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right 
                before serving.</li>
        </ol>
