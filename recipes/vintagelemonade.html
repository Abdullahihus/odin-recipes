    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 Lemons</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups of white sugar</li>
                <li>1 ¼ quarts water</li>

            </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut 
                    them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
                <li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. 
                    Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins 
                    to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
                <li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the 
                    hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to 
                    cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a 
                    strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and 
                    pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li>
            </ol>
